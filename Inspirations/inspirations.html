                <h3>Benny Gold</h3>
                <p4>Benny Gold is a local SF Graphic Designer who had a storefront for many years in SF. He has inspired many streetwear brands in the past years. His classic design with typography inspires my design and style. Using fun and unique typographic elements to carry his message across really inspires me to create more unique and memorable designs!</p4>

                <h3>Alex Trochut</h3>
                <p4>Alex is a Spanish graphic designer who is known for his playful designs with typography. I've used Alex as an inspiration to be more playful with my design and give it more personally. Finding elements to carry my typography instead of it being plain text. Alex defines what elements within typography can be and that is something I want to master one day!</p4>

                <h3>Lance Wyman</h3>
                <p4>Lance Wyman has been known for having some of the greatest Iconography in history. He has created some of the most classic designs that have inspired many throughout the years! ( Apple iPod Campaign). Lance has inspired me to create good design that can speak by itself. Create design that is more accessible to the general public. Creating simple designs that can embody more information than just being a nice design.</p4>
